# Project Name: Threat Intelligence Aggregator
Description:
The Threat Intelligence Aggregator project is designed to collect, aggregate, and analyze threat intelligence feeds from various sources to provide actionable insights for security teams. It serves as a central repository for threat data, enabling security analysts to make informed decisions and enhance their organization's cybersecurity posture.

## Key Features:

Feed Integration: Supports integration with multiple threat intelligence feeds, including open-source feeds, commercial feeds, and internal sources.
Data Normalization: Normalizes incoming threat intelligence data into a standardized format for consistency and ease of analysis.
Enrichment: Enriches threat intelligence data with additional context, such as indicators of compromise (IOCs), malware hashes, and associated threat actors.
Correlation: Correlates threat intelligence data with internal security events and logs to identify potential threats and indicators of compromise (IOCs).
Scoring and Prioritization: Assigns risk scores or priority levels to threats based on their severity, relevance, and impact on the organization.
Alerting and Reporting: Generates alerts and reports for identified threats, including recommended remediation actions and mitigation strategies.

## Technologies Used:

Backend: Python (e.g., Django or Flask) for data processing and analysis
Database: MongoDB or Elasticsearch for storing and querying threat intelligence data
Integration: APIs for integrating with threat intelligence feeds, SIEMs, and other security tools
Frontend: Optional frontend interface for visualization and analysis (e.g., React.js or Dash)
