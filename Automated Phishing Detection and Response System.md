# Project Title: Automated Phishing Detection and Response System

## Description:

The Automated Phishing Detection and Response System project aims to enhance an organization's security posture by automating the detection, analysis, and response to phishing attacks. Phishing remains one of the most prevalent and effective methods used by cybercriminals to breach organizations, making timely detection and response critical for mitigating risks and protecting sensitive information.

## Key Features:

Email Monitoring: Monitors incoming emails for indicators of phishing, including suspicious sender addresses, malicious URLs, and phishing keywords.
Phishing Detection: Utilizes machine learning algorithms or rule-based techniques to classify emails as phishing or legitimate based on predefined criteria and historical patterns.
Real-Time Analysis: Performs real-time analysis of suspicious emails to extract metadata, analyze email headers, and identify phishing tactics (e.g., spoofing, social engineering).
Automated Response: Automatically responds to detected phishing emails by quarantining them, blocking malicious URLs, or notifying users and security teams for further investigation.
User Training Integration: Integrates with phishing awareness training platforms to provide immediate feedback to users who may have fallen victim to phishing attempts and deliver targeted training modules.
Incident Reporting: Generates incident reports and alerts detailing the characteristics of detected phishing attacks, including affected users, timestamps, and remediation actions taken.

## Technologies Used:

Email Analysis: Python libraries such as imaplib or exchangelib for interacting with email servers and analyzing email content.
Machine Learning: Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, or PyTorch for developing machine learning models for phishing detection.
Automation: Ansible, Puppet, or custom scripts for automating response actions and workflow orchestration.
Integration: APIs and webhooks for integrating with email servers, security tools (e.g., SIEM, endpoint protection), and user training platforms.

## Potential Extensions:

Phishing URL Analysis: Integrates with threat intelligence feeds and URL scanning services to analyze and categorize phishing URLs based on reputation and threat intelligence.
User Feedback Loop: Establishes a feedback loop where user-reported phishing emails contribute to the training and refinement of the detection system.
Multi-Channel Detection: Expands phishing detection capabilities beyond email to include other communication channels such as messaging apps and social media platforms.
Customization and Tuning: Provides configuration options for fine-tuning detection rules, adjusting response actions, and adapting to evolving phishing techniques.
Compliance Reporting: Generates compliance reports demonstrating the organization's efforts to combat phishing attacks and protect sensitive information.
