# Project Title: Security Incident Dashboard

Description: The Security Incident Dashboard project aims to provide a centralized platform for monitoring and managing security incidents within an organization's Security Operations Center (SOC). It allows SOC analysts to track, prioritize, and respond to security incidents effectively.

## Key Features:

1.  Incident Tracking: Enables SOC analysts to log security incidents, including details such as incident type, severity, affected systems, and timestamp.
2.  Prioritization: Provides a mechanism for assigning priority levels to incidents based on their impact and urgency.
3.  Workflow Management: Supports customizable workflows for incident response, including stages such as triage, investigation, containment, and resolution.
4.  Notification System: Integrates with notification channels (e.g., email, Slack) to alert SOC team members about new incidents or updates.
5.  Reporting: Generates reports and metrics on incident trends, response times, and resolution status for management and compliance purposes.
6.  Dashboard Interface: Presents an intuitive and user-friendly dashboard interface for visualizing incident data, trends, and key performance indicators (KPIs).

## Technologies Used:

-   Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (e.g., React.js)
-   Backend: Python (e.g., Django or Flask)
-   Database: PostgreSQL or MySQL for storing incident data
-   Integration: APIs for integrating with existing security tools and systems (e.g., SIEM, ticketing systems)

## Potential Extensions:

-   Integration with threat intelligence feeds to enrich incident data.
-   Automated response actions based on predefined playbooks.
-   Role-based access control (RBAC) for managing user permissions.
-   Support for multi-tenancy to serve multiple clients or business units.
-   Integration with SOAR (Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response) platforms for automated incident handling.
